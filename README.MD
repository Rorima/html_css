# HTML5 & CSS3

These are all of the studies and exercises I did while learning HTML5 and CSS3.

You can find in text format all of the notes I took in the file named "notes.md". This was my first time writing organized notes about my learning, so you will notice that the main structure of how I take these notes changes over time. On future courses I'll probably be able to do better.
