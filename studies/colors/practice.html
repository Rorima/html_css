    <h2 style="color:#61e361;">The First Wormhole Created by Humans Using a Quantum Computer.</h2>

    <p style="color:#61e361;">Google scientists discovered a way to create wormholes using a quantum computer and Artificial Inteligence. This is a major feat that might prove that General Relativty Theory and Quantum Physics are linked.</p>
    
    <p style="color:#61e361;">Almost a century ago, Albert Einstein realized that the equations of general relativity could produce wormholes. But it would take a number of theoretical leaps and a “crazy” team of experimentalists to build one on Google's quantum computer. [this text was copied from a youtube video description]</p>
