    <h1>The Benefits of Learning How to Code</h1>

    <p>Programming is the career of the future. It is no secret that we don't have nearly enough programmers to keep up
        with the demand on the market right now. Because of this, there are a lot of programmers that juggle between
        jobs and get a full salary on each one of them.</p>

    <p>Even if you don't want to work with programming, there are a lot of benefits in learning it. You'll cerrtainly
        get smarter, because every good programmer is a good researcher and a good problem-solver. Programmers are
        curious and always want to learn more. There are people who are born this way, and there are people who learn to
        live this way, and by learning how to code, even if you weren't born with a lot of those skills, you'll be able
        to develop them by learning to program.</p>

    <p>Being able to code is like having a superpower. You might have a problem, like renaming thousands of files in
        your
        computer. This could take you days if you did it by hand, but knowing a programming language, it would take you
        less
        than 30 minutes to write a program that would do that for you.</p>

    <h3>How to learn a programming language?</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Choose a language with purpose.</b></dt>
        <dd>You should know what you want to learn and why.</dd>

        <dt><b>Start with the basics.</b></dt>
        <dd>You may be tempted to jump to intermediate courses or try taking on multiple classes at once, but it's best
            to get the fundamentals down before moving on.</dd>

        <dt><b>Practice the code.</b></dt>
        <dd>Reading about how the language works and its different variables is helpful, but until you start coding and
            figuring out solutions on your own, you won't truly understand it.</dd>

        <dt><b>Set realistic goals and stick to them.</b></dt>
        <dd>Try setting aside a specific time for learning each week.</dd>
