    <h1>Keep on Learning</h1>

    <p>Don't learn just how to code. In a little time AI will learn to code better than you. You have to figure out a way to build things instead of just writting code. You have to find a job that a machine can't do yet, and building apps might be one of them. Building an app is like a journey, and coding is just one little part of it. There are a lot more things involved in the creation of apps. If you want to stay relevant and hirable, do what machines can't perform yet, nor will be able in some time in the future.</p>
